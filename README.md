# Server Driven with SwiftUI

## Implementation 

A json example is at `Resources/footer.json`
The implemented types are under `Sources` suffixed with _SD_. `ViewSD` is a flexible type that can instantiate any view given its `__typename`. 
Go to the type implementation swift file to see the keys & values handled.

Open the playground and run the main file to see the live view.
